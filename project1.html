  	<h1>CSCI 6907 Project 1: Aligning and Compositing the Images</h1>
  	<div>
  	<h4> Junhao Chen</h4>

    <p> In this project, we learn how to align images and composite the RGB channel into a colorful image without ghosting. The write-up will start from preprocessing the image to finally using a different way to align the image's RGB channels.</p>

    <h4> Part 1: Remove the White Edge</h4>
    
    <p>For the accuracy of the future calculation, I want to remove the edges of the image, which might cause an error in aligning process. We can find out through the image below that the images have two edges, the white one and the black one.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="600" src="./imgs3/white_edge.png"/>
    </figure>
    
    <p>The basic idea is to use the threshold to separate the white edge from the image and then use the contour finder to get the location of the white trim. To be specific, I firstly to median blur to make the border between the white edge and the black edge smoother. I set 5 as the kernel size of the median blur. And then, I use the 150 as the threshold because some of the black edges are gray rather than black. Finally, the find contour will return the location of contours, and I choose the minimum of xs and ys as the left top point and the maximum of xs and ys as the bottom right point of the image. The removal process is shown below.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="1200" src="./imgs3/remove_process.png"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Removing the white edge is relatively easy, while it is difficult to remove the black edge. Because it is a grayscale image, the black edge could fuse with the image itself. Thus, it is impossible to remove the black edge perfectly. An example of the image without a white edge is shown below.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="700" src="./imgs3/remove_result.png"/>
    </figure>

  	<h4> Part 2: Single Scale Implementation</h4>

  	<p> As the easiest way to align images, the single scale implementation  is quite straightforward using the Euclidean distance: <code> d = ||image1 - image2|| </code> as the metrics. 
    </p>

    <p>Because the size of the images is not the same, setting a fixed maximum offset, like [-15, 15], is not flexible and effective for all kinds of pictures. I use the [-5%, 5%] of the image size as the boundary of the offset. And the comparable area, therefore, should be the rest 90% of that image.</p>


    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="250" src="./imgs3/move.png"/>
    </figure>


    <p>After calculate all the distance, I choose the pair of offset which has the closest distance as the final result. Here are some examples of alignment.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="250" src="./imgs3/single_with1.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption">With Alignment</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="250" src="./imgs3/single_without1.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Without Alignment</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="250" src="./imgs3/single_with2.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption">With Alignment</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="250" src="./imgs3/single_without2.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Without Alignment</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>It is evident that the first example is more excellent than the result without alignment, while the second alignment makes the effect even worse. For the second pair of images, we could find there is an unfitted Blue channel in the picture. This large deviation causes the unnatural appearance of this image. I think the diverse distribution of each color is the main reason. For example, the grass has a large value in the Green channel but may be less in Red. This difference results in the gap of different color channels appearing in the alignment. It could also explain why the first photo is perfect. While the RGB are in the same distribution, the image should look white rather than colorful.</p>

    <h4> Part 3: Improve the Performance Using Adaptive Threshold </h4>

    <p>For the problem above, a gradient field could be a great solution. Rather than using the exact RGB value, the change in each pixel could be better for alignment. However, I use the adaptive threshold. This method scans the image and sets the pixel value to 255 if its value is larger than the threshold. And the threshold value is adaptive, which is equal to the mean value of pixels in a block. </p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="340" src="./imgs3/adapt1.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b></b> </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="340" src="./imgs3/adapt2.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b>Adaptive Threshold</b> </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="340" src="./imgs3/adapt3.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b></b> </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Although the adaptive threshold method cost a little more time, the performance improved a lot. Some of the result images are just perfect and shown below. More results are available at the end of the write-up.
    </p>

    </figure>


  	<h4> Part 4: Multi-scale Implementation </h4>

  	<p> Although the single-scale implementation works while dealing with small-size images, it seems impossible to get the result of the large-size image. For those large images, the program needs to run more than 100k iterations to check all the situations, which might cost more than one day to get the result of one image. Thus, it is inevitable to use the coarse-to-fine search strategy.</p> 

    <p> For the multi-scale implementation, I downsample the image to a small size, get the current of offset and finally combine this coarse-scale offset with the finer-scale offset. However, for that large image, one time downsampling is not enough. I reset the offset range to the largest power number of 5% of the image size, which is <code> 3^floor(log(graph_size*5%, 3)) </code>. Thus, the times of downsampling could be <code> floor(log(graph_size*5%, 3)) </code> till the coarsest offset range to be [-1, 1]. The whole process is shown below. </p>

    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs3/downsample.png"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b>Multi-scale Implementation</b> </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This method decrease the number of iteration from 100k to about 60, highly increasing the processing effeciency. And all the results are shown below.</p>

    <h4> Summary </h4>

    <p>From preprocessing the image to single-scale implementation, I wondered why we still need the multi-scale implementation. I did not realize that it would cost so much time for the larger image until I found that it was impossible to get the result. It is a straightforward but effective strategy! Most of the output images are great for the final results, except the image of the train. I checked the alignment of the Blue channel and Green channel. And I found out that the Red channel image, much bigger than the rest channels, caused the bad result of alignment. Thus, the rescaling process could be helpful for future improvement.</p>
