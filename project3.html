  	<h1>CSCI 6907 Project 3: Image Mosaicing</h1>
  	<div>
  	<h4> Junhao Chen</h4>

    <p> In this project, we learn how to create a mosaic that connects multiple photos together into one picture. This project will test warping and blending functions on two photographs and finally apply them to create a mosaic by projective warping, resampling, and compositing the pictures. </p>

    <h4> Part 1: Choose Image </h4>
    
    <p>Those four photos below are taken in my living room. I took these photos from different views. I put the TV in the middle, not because I want to show my brand new 55" television and Hi-fi sound bar, but it could be an excellent reference for our future warping.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="300" src="./imgs/1.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="300" src="./imgs/2.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="300" src="./imgs/3.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" width="300" src="./imgs/4.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    
    <p>The left half TV can help compose the first and the second image. The right half TV can help compose the second and the third image. To compose the third and the forth image, I choose the typical object in these images, like chandelier, table, plant and the chair, as our reference point to calculate the H matrix. These factors could make the warping process easier. We could also find out the forth image is much darker than the previous one. Although it could make the blending process harder, we want to make the seam more noticable to test the performance of our blend function.</p>

  	<h4> Part 2: Recover homographies </h4>

  	<p> In order to do the wraping, we will compute homography matrices and use them to warp the images. Only after warping, can we clip those photos in a proper position. For each pixel in the original photo, we assume that <code> p </code> is its <code>[x, y, 1]</code>. And for its new position <code> p'</code>, we need to use <code> H * p = p'</code> to get it. This homography has 8 degrees of freedom which we simpliy into 7 by setting the scaling factor, w, to be 1. And the <code> H * p = p'</code> is shown below.
    </p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="100" src="./imgs/equation1.jpg"/>
    </figure>

    <p> H is the homography, (x, y) is the pixel on the image that will be warped and the (x', y') is the position of the pixel that we want to warp (x, y) to. w in this case is the scaling factor. We want to solve for a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h above. To solve these eight parameters easier, We expand the dot product of the matrix, we could have following euqations.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="100" src="./imgs/equation2.jpg"/>
    </figure>

    <p>We then solve them and remove the w in the equation and we could get following equations.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="60" src="./imgs/equation3.jpg"/>
    </figure>

    <p>For each point, we could get two equations above. To solve and get the result of the eight parameters, at least eight equations are needed, which means we need to know 4 pairs of points before and after the warping. Moreover, We could use multiple (more than 4) points to increase the accuracy of the warp and transformation, using the equation below. To ensure we could solve the H matrix, the four points are not just randomly chosen. None three of them should be on the same line.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/equation4.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    
    <p>One of the tedious processes is to get the location of the points we would like to use to calculate the H matrix. Thus, I write a function which could return the location of the points and store them in a txt file when I click the mouse on that image. This could highly simplify how we could get those locations.</p>

  	<h4> Part 3: Warp the images </h4>

  	<p> The warping is matching the origin pixel to the pixel in the warped image. However, in the implementation of the warp function, it could be easier find what the origin pixel is while traversing all the pixel in the new image. For those non-integer results, I simply round them to integers. I set the RGB value of the new pixel as (0,0,0) if the origin position of that pixel locate outside the original image. The result of the four rectified images are shown below.</p> 


    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/out1.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption">Warped picture 1</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/out2.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Warped picture 2 </figcaption>
    </figure>
     <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/out3.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Warped picture 3 </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/out4.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Warped picture 4 </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4> Part 4: Blend images into a mosaic  </h4>

    <p>After warping, two images should have some overlapping area. Blending those image in this area could help the image look more natural through the transition area.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="300" src="./imgs/blend.jpg"/>
    </figure>

    <p>I firstly implement the simplest way to compose two images. Just stitch two images half-half. However, the seams shows below in the transition area as what we expect.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="500" src="./imgs/w_img1.jpg"/>
    </figure>

    <p>This is not the result I want. Thus, I choose to use the Laplacian Pyramid to sample the two images and try to make them blend better. What influence the result could be the level of the pyramid. To find how the level of pyramid works, we generate blend area with different levels show below. Through the comparison we could also choose the best result as our final level of pyramid.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test3.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b>Level 3</b> </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test4.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Level 4 </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test5.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Level 5 </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test6.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Level 6 </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test7.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Level 7 </figcaption>
    </figure><figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test8.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> Level 8 </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="600" src="./imgs/test9.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b>Level 9</b> </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>As the level of pyramid increases, the seam blurs making the transition more natural. Nevertheless, the other objects and the background also blur. In this trade-off, I pefer the result of 7-level Laplacian pyramid. I finally choose it to get our final result shown below.</p>

    <figure class="item">
    <img class="u-max-full-width" height="500" src="./imgs/final.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="caption"> <b>Final Result</b> </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h4> Summary </h4>

    <p> It was interesting to see how everything worked to arrive at the final mosaicing. There were a number of different steps, but it was great to see how the pictures from different views all fit together and eventually results in the final mosaic. If I have enough time, I would like to implement other blending methods. And also I would like to try to compose the video into a large image. And it could explain how the Pano mode on iphone camera works.</p>
